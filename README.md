# WOTC
An easy-to-maintain Work Opportunity Tax Credit calculator website

The official Department of Labor (DOL) and Oregon state sites for the Work Opportunity Tax Credit
do not have online calculators to let people see their specific credit. The DOL site has an Excel
spreadsheet that you can download.

This set of files includes a form that asks questions about potential WOTC opportunities, and a
JavaScript file that is built to be easily maintainable by a department-level web admin. The code
is written more as a script than a true program, and is thoroughly commented.

Before criticizing the code, please remember the purpose - it must be easy to read and understand
by someone who is not a programmer.

Update 04162016:

Fixed a bug where the "length of employment" option was hidden even when it was required in order to get the correct WOTC value
