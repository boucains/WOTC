            RE: Work for Training Proposal<br>

        </address>

        <p>Dear Mr. Kaiser-Nyman, </p>

        <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this proposal. You and your staff are busy, especially with a new class to enroll and expansion into Seattle. I believe this proposal could be beneficial to both of us, especially right now, but the fact is that I am asking for a hand up because I am out of options.
        </p>

        <p>I am a service-connected disabled vet who would like to attend Epicodus, but funding is an issue. I have employment incentives from two Federal sources totaling approximately $12,100. Most of this money is only available if I am your employee. The proposal below details many costs and benefits from trading approximately one year’s employment plus these incentives for your training. The overview explains my skills and the circumstances that brought me to this request.
        </p>

        <p>Please allow me some time with you or your representative in person to provide further details. I hope that the creative thinking behind this proposal provides some evidence of my ability to find unique solutions to problems, a talent that saved Seagate Technology over a million dollars across eight years. I truly believe that I can provide services to Epicodus that will make this a clear benefit to your company, your staff, and your students.
        </p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>

        <h1>Executive Summary</h1>

        <p>I am a disabled veteran who is requesting a hand up, not a hand out. After an injury and layoff in 2009, I am out of personal resources and options. This proposal allows me to attend Epicodus while providing a clear financial mechanism for you to recoup those costs and more.
        </p>

        <p>There are several possible scenarios. Most likely, I would begin by performing an approximately four-week internship at no cost to you, sponsored by the <a href="http://www.rebootnw.org/" target="_blank">Federal “Reboot” program</a>. Upon successful completion, I would become an employee of Epicodus for between 52 and 65 weeks in order for you to receive a <a href="https://www.doleta.gov/business/incentives/opptax/" target="_blank">Work Opportunity Tax Credit</a> (WOTC). My hourly rate would be between $9.25 and $11.54 per hour, but the effective rate would be somewhat higher as explained below. At some point during this time I would attend a full course of Epicodus training. No health insurance, vacation, or other benefits are expected.
        </p>

        <p>I have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnpatrickcain" target="_blank">wide range of technical and administrative skills</a> that are of use supporting your busy staff, as well as a lifelong drive to help others.

        <h2>Effective Hourly Wage Adjustments</h2>

        <p>Wages during training are essential. Working full time during training is unrealistic. The minimum hours worked while training is suggested to be 10 hours per week. You may feel that the effective wage shown is too high (or too low). If you feel that either of the default values is unacceptable, changing them will change the effective wage.

                <h1>Overview</h1>

                <p><strong>I am asking for your help.</strong> Seven years ago, I was laid off two weeks after having major surgery. While I have recovered, I still have some physical limitations. Even though I obtained a Web Development & Design AAS from PCC, I have been unable to obtain a job since graduation. My family is teetering on the edge of homelessness. I need a hand up to get back on my feet. Please consider whether your company can afford to be part of this process.
                </p>

                <h2>What I can Bring to the Table</h2>

                <p>My most useful characteristic is my curiosity. I like to analyze complex problems and find innovative solutions. I am adaptable, and I know how to follow. I accept people for who they are, and feel that respecting each other as fellow human beings is the basis for a sound work and civic environment.
                    I am comfortable speaking in any environment to anyone, and helping others is a life-long pattern for me. Examples include:

                <p>I’ve done many things in my career(s). I’ve done production scheduling for factories, programmed 3-axis CNC manufacturing equipment, and made the cover of Popular Science as part of a product design team. Switching focus, I provided desktop support, sales and service, run a help desk at IBM, built global computer infrastructure and negotiated ground-breaking software licensing features. Far from being a poly-proficient rock star, my opportunities have been driven by my curiosity and willingness to adapt to new environments. Working with and learning form others, I’ve been lucky to have no end of challenges to tackle.</p>

                </div>

                <p>My last position was at Seagate Technology, where I worked for eight years, finishing as a Systems Senior Engineer in their Global Client Server Engineering team. By 2008, a military service-connected injury limited me to a 20-hour work week. On December 31, 2008, I had surgery to correct this injury. Two weeks later, Seagate had the first of several large layoffs. Even though I had been awarded a 10% Key Performer bonus for 2009 in addition to my $82K salary, I was part of the first RIF. While at PCC I realized that I am better suited for development than design. The development aspect of training was not sufficient to prepare me for work in the field.

                <p>Please see my LinkedIn profile for complete details, and my resume is attached to this proposal. In general, I am physically able to perform any tasks normally done in an office environment. I have experience as a scheduler, and can serve as an assistant to most of your staff. I have experience licensing, purchasing and supporting computer hardware and software. I have a degree in Web Development and Design, but no practical experience in this arena. I am not afraid to talk to anyone, and have experience doing demonstrations and dealing with customers at trade events.

            <h1>Costs and Benefits to Epicodus</h1>

            <p>In order to meet the requirements for the maximum WOTC credit, my hourly wage would need to be $11.64, paid as 40 hours per week for 52 weeks. This results in a WOTC credit of 40% of my earnings for a total tax credit of $9,600. Another Federal program would add approximately $1,000 to reimburse you for part of my OJT. During my training period, my tuition would be deducted from my pay. Also during my training, I would work 10 hours per week above the time in class. Once training is completed, I would move to a standard 40 hours per week for the remaining 27 weeks in the year employment. This makes my effective pay rate $13.84 per hour after accounting for training time.In order to meet the requirements for the maximum WOTC credit, my hourly wage would need to be $11.64, paid as 40 hours per week for 52 weeks.

            <h1>SWOT</h1>

            <h2>Strengths</h2>

            <p>The internship provides a no-cost way to evaluate my performance, abilities and attitude.
                Guaranteed work availability after training allows planning for future work.
                WOTC provides 40% credit against wages up to $9,600.
                Track record of volunteer service in tech (see LinkedIn profile)
                Training costs paid from wages reduce the total cost of employment
            </p>

            <h2>Weaknesses</h2>

            <p>Loss of outside cash flow by taking a training slot
                Unplanned employee onboard affects expansion planning
                Initial decrease in productivity from training to assist existing people / processes.
            </p>

            <h2>Opportunities</h2>

            <p>Equipment maintenance after normal class hours
                Expanded help hours after training
                Assistance to current employees during expansion, student onboarding
                Assistance to instructors so they can concentrate on students instead of paperwork
                Help to long-term unemployed veteran, social impact, taxes, etc.
            </p>

            <h2>Threats</h2>

            <p>Extra cash outflow from unplanned wages
                Unexpected employment termination before required period is complete
                Insufficient productivity to justify wages
                Unexpected decrease in class size – decreased revenue
                Personality conflicts

                <h1>Cost Recovery</h1>

                <h2>Tuition</h2>

                <p>Epicodus will lose the $5,000 external revenue from a different student, however the total recovery is far more than the lost tuition. The cost of my tuition would be recovered through payroll deduction.  Once 2080 (52 weeks full-time equivalent) hours are paid, the Work Opportunity Tax Credit is recovered as a credit against that tax year’s payroll taxes. The total OJT payment from the Federal Reboot program can be paid in several ways, but is an upfront value between $1,000 and $2,500.
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>Effective Payroll</h2>

                <p>Another way to look at the recovery of costs is to show payroll costs for the period of employment.
                    The total cost of payroll, including employer share, is $26,859.58 for 2080 (52 weeks full-time equivalent) hours. That cost is increased by the loss of external tuition revenue and the cost of my tuition. The costs are then reduced by the value of the OJT component ($1,000 - $2,500), the payback of the tuition through payroll deduction, and the value of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit of $9,600.     The resulting effective cost of payroll is $21,259.58.
                </p>

                <hr>

                <h2>Weekly Payroll Cost</h2>

                <p>The employer cost of payroll is more than the wages paid. Your exact payroll percentages paid for taxes may be slightly different, but this shows a representative list of payroll costs.
                </p>

                <h2>Tax Rates Used</h2>

                <h1>Hourly Wage Discussion</h1>

                <h2>Overview</h2>

                <p>Mixing training with payroll is complicated. Actual amounts paid vary depending on the value of the Reboot OJT payment and the exact hourly rate. This is an attempt to provide one alternative and show the effective hourly rate you would be paying.
                </p>

                <h2>Actual Hours Worked</h2>

                <p>Attempting to work for you full time while attending class would be unrealistic. I estimate that while in class I could work an additional 10 hours per week. This plan depends on being paid throughout the year at the same rate, however. While this sounds unreasonable, the amount of credits involved make this amount much closer to a fair value. A 40-hour workweek while not in training would be normal.
                </p>

                <h2>Effective Hourly Wage (including Employer Tax Portions)</h2>

                <p>While the actual minimum hourly rate that satisfies the Work Opportunity Tax Credit is $11.54 for a year, that rate is based on a 40-hour week. Because I would only be working a 10-hour week while in training, my effective pay rate would be higher. The effect total payroll is obtaining by the following:
                    (52 weeks * 40 hours) – ((40 hours paid – 10 hours worked) * 27 weeks of class) = 1270 hours worked
                    $21,259.58 the effective year’s payroll cost / 1270 hours worked = $16.74 per hour worked, which includes the employer’s portions of the payroll taxes.
                </p>

                <h2>Effective Hourly Wage (not including Employer Tax Portion)</h2>

                <p>For normal comparisons, hourly rates are based on the employee’s portion, which is not the full amount paid by the employer, but is used for reference. For the purpose of roughing out the job responsibilities, the effective hourly wage excluding the employer share is $14.49. Given that my last paid position paid me $82K plus a 10% key performer bonus, I’m hoping that appropriate tasks are available that align with the tasks normally paid for a position paying $14.49 per hour.
                </p>
