            RE: Work for Training Proposal<br>

        </address>

        <p>Dear Mr. Kaiser-Nyman,</p>

        <p>Thank you for taking the time to read this proposal. You and your staff are busy, especially with a new class to enroll and expansion into Seattle. While I believe this proposal could be beneficial to both of us, especially right now, the fact is that I am asking for a hand up because I am out of options.
        </p>

        <p>I am a service-connected disabled vet who would like to attend Epicodus, but funding is an issue. I have employment incentives from two Federal sources totaling approximately $12,100. Most of this money is only available if I am your employee. The proposal below details many costs and benefits from trading approximately one year’s employment plus these incentives for your training. The overview explains my skills and the circumstances that brought me to this request.
        </p>

        <p>Please allow me some time with you or your representative in person to provide further details. I hope that the creative thinking behind this proposal provides some evidence of my ability to find unique solutions to problems, a talent that saved Seagate Technology over a million dollars across eight years. I truly believe that I can provide services to Epicodus that will make this a clear benefit to your company, your staff, and your students.
        </p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>

        <h1>Executive Summary</h1>

        <p>I am a disabled veteran who is requesting a hand up, not a hand out. After an injury and layoff in 2009, I am out of personal resources and options. This proposal allows me to attend Epicodus while providing a clear financial mechanism for you to recoup those costs and more.
        </p>

        <p>This proposal has many inherently flexible parameters. In the most likely scenario, I would begin by performing an approximately four-week internship at no cost to you, sponsored by the <a href="http://www.rebootnw.org/" target="_blank">Federal “Reboot” program</a>. Upon successful completion, I would become an employee of Epicodus for between 52 and 65 weeks in order for you to receive a <a href="https://www.doleta.gov/business/incentives/opptax/" target="_blank">Work Opportunity Tax Credit</a> (WOTC). My hourly rate would be between $9.25 and $11.54 per hour, but the effective rate would be somewhat higher as explained below. At some point during this time I would attend a full course of Epicodus training. No health insurance, vacation, or other benefits are expected. Nothing in this proposal is meant to limit the end date of my employment, but simply tracks the period required to get the maximum WOTC.
        </p>

        <p>I have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnpatrickcain" target="_blank">wide range of technical and administrative skills</a> that are of use supporting your busy staff, as well as a lifelong drive to help others.

        <h2>Effective Hourly Wage Adjustments</h2>

        <p>Wages during training are essential. Working full time during training is unrealistic. The minimum hours worked while training is suggested to be 10 hours per week. You may feel that the effective wage shown is too high (or too low). If you feel that either of the default values is unacceptable, changing them will change the effective wage.

                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p><strong>I am asking for your help.</strong> Seven years ago, I was laid off two weeks after having major surgery. While I have recovered, I still have some physical limitations. Even though I obtained a Web Development & Design AAS from PCC, I have been unable to obtain a job since graduation. My family is teetering on the edge of homelessness. I need a hand up to get back on my feet. Please consider whether your company can afford to be part of this process.
                </p>

                <p>In return for a full course of training while an employee, Epicodus would receive a no-cost four-week internship, my service near minimum wage for 1 - 1.25 years, and a $9,600 Work Opportunity Tax Credit. I would also pay for my tuition out of my wages, effectively increasing the value proposition further. </p>

                <h2>What I Can Bring to the Table</h2>

                <h3>Interpersonal Approach</h3>

                <p>I am adaptable, and I know how to follow. My most useful characteristic is my curiosity. I like to analyze complex problems and find innovative solutions. I accept people for who they are, and feel that respecting each other as human beings is the basis for a sound work and civic environment. I am comfortable speaking in any environment to anyone, and helping others is a life-long pattern for me. My broad curiosity and detailed approach mean that I tend to provide more information than most people need. I struggle when dealing with people who deliberately take advantage of others, especially those who cannot fight back.</p>

                <h3>Work History</h3>

                <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnpatrickcain" target="_blank">My work history is quite diverse.</a> I’ve done production scheduling for factories, programmed 3-axis CNC manufacturing equipment, and made the cover of Popular Science as part of a product design team. Switching focus, I then provided PC and Mac desktop support, sales and service, ran a small help desk at IBM, designed and built global computer infrastructure and negotiated first of its kind software licensing features. Far from being a poly-proficient rock star, my opportunities have arisen from my curiosity and willingness to learn from others. I’ve been lucky to have opportunities and challenges to motivate me to continuously learn and explore.</p>

                <p>My last position was at Seagate Technology, where I worked for eight years, finishing as a Systems Senior Engineer in their Global Client Server Engineering team. By 2008, a military service-connected injury limited me to a 20-hour work week. On December 31, 2008, I had surgery to correct this injury. Two weeks later, Seagate had the first of several large layoffs. Even though I had been awarded a 10% Key Performer bonus for 2009 in addition to my $82K salary, I was part of the first RIF. While at PCC I realized that I am better suited for web development than design. The development aspect of my training was not sufficient to prepare me for work in the field.

        <h2>Effective Payroll <span id="effPayrollChart"><a href="#waterfallChart" target="_self">(chart)</a></span></h2>

            <p>It takes $24,000 in wages to generate the maximum WOTC. That total does not change, only the amount of time involved. This means that the hourly wage on paper can vary from about $11.54/hr for a years’ time to the minimum wage of $9.25/hr for 1.25 years’ time. The employer’s share of taxes adds another $2,856 to the cost of payroll, for a total of $26, 856.
            </p>

            <p>Next, that cost is increased by the loss of external tuition revenue and the cost of my tuition. The new total of $36,856 is then reduced by the tuition paid back through my wages (-$5,000) and the WOTC (-$9,600). That brings the effective payroll outlay down to $22,256.
            </p>

            <p class="navPaddingBottom">Finally, there is a four-week internship involved at no cost to you. For a pay rate of $9.25, this reduces the effective payroll $1,480 to $20,778. For a pay rate of $11.54, the effective payroll is reduced by $1,846 to $20,409.

        <section id="hrWage" class="navPaddingTop">

            <h1>Hourly Wage Discussion</h1>

            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>Mixing training with payroll is complicated. Actual amounts paid vary depending on the value of the Reboot OJT payment and the exact hourly rate. This is an attempt to provide one alternative and show the effective hourly rate you would be paying.
            </p>

            <h2>Actual Hours Worked</h2>

            <p>Attempting to work for you full time while attending class would be unrealistic. I estimate that while in class I could work an additional 10 hours per week. This plan depends on being paid throughout the year at the same rate, however. While this sounds unreasonable, the amount of credits involved make this amount much closer to a fair value. A 40-hour workweek while not in training would be normal.
            </p>

            <h2>Effective Hourly Wage (including Employer Tax Portions)</h2>

            <p>While the actual minimum hourly rate that satisfies the Work Opportunity Tax Credit is $11.54 for a year, that rate is based on a 40-hour week. Because I would only be working a 10-hour week while in training, my effective pay rate would be higher. The effect total payroll is obtaining by the following:
                (52 weeks * 40 hours) – ((40 hours paid – 10 hours worked) * 27 weeks of class) = 1270 hours worked
                $21,259.58 the effective year’s payroll cost / 1270 hours worked = $16.74 per hour worked, which includes the employer’s portions of the payroll taxes.
            </p>

            <h2>Effective Hourly Wage (not including Employer Tax Portion)</h2>

            <p>For normal comparisons, hourly rates are based on the employee’s portion, which is not the full amount paid by the employer, but is used for reference. For the purpose of roughing out the job responsibilities, the effective hourly wage excluding the employer share is $14.49. Given that my last paid position paid me $82K plus a 10% key performer bonus, I’m hoping that appropriate tasks are available that align with the tasks normally paid for a position paying $14.49 per hour.

            <h2>Weekly Payroll Cost</h2>
