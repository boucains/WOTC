        <h1>Executive Summary</h1>

        <p>I am a disabled veteran who is requesting a hand up, not a hand out. After an injury and layoff in 2009, I am out of personal resources and options. This proposal allows me to attend Epicodus while providing a clear financial mechanism for you to recoup those costs and more.
        </p>

        <p>There are several possible scenarios. Most likely, I would begin by performing a four-week internship at no cost to you, sponsored by the Federal “Reboot” program. Upon successful completion, I would become an employee of Epicodus for a minimum of a year, attending school and working for $11.54/hr. This combination of hourly wage and time frame meets the minimum required to obtain the full amount of the Work Opportunity Tax Credit (WOTC). WOTC provides a credit back on your Federal taxes at the rate of 40% of my hourly wage up to a credit of $9,600. No health insurance, vacation, or other benefits are expected or included in these numbers.
        </p>

        <p>I have a wide range of technical and administrative skills that are of use supporting your busy staff, as well as a lifelong drive to help others.
        </p>

        <ul>

            <li>Net Total Year Cost = $22,260</li>

            <li>Total Minimum Time Period ≈ 1 Year @ 27 weeks training + 10
                hrs/wk work and 25 weeks of full-time work</li>

            <li>Total Maximum Time Period ≈ 1.4 years @ 27 weeks training + 10
                hrs/wk work and 45 weeks of full-time work </li>

            <li>Net Hourly Wage ≈ $17.53 (not including the free four-week internship)</li>

        </ul>

        <ul>Benefits to Epicodus:

            <li>Estimated Non-Training Work Hours = 1,270 - 2080</li>

            <li>Four Week Internship at No Cost</li>

            <li>WOTC Credit = $9,600 </li>

            <li>Training Repaid from Wages = $5,000</li>

        </ul>

        <ul>Costs to Epicodus:

            <li>Wages Social Security Tax</li>

            <li>Employer Share Medicare Tax</li>

            <li>Employer Share Unemployment Insurance Tax</li>

            <li>Workman’s Compensation</li>

            <li>Lost External Cash from Training = $5,000</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Options</h2>

        <p>Length of Employment / Hourly Wage: The minimum employment period required to get the WOTC credit is 400 paid hours. The credit is calculated at 40% of wages. By varying the length of employment / hourly wage ratio, adjustments can be made to the proposal, i.e. extending the employment period because the net wage is too high to justify hiring while training.
            OJT / Internship: The Reboot grant has options, but is limited by conditions. Instead of a four-week internship, this money could be paid directly to Epicodus to compensate for OJT. This decreases the total time and the net hourly wage, but would most likely require a waiver from the Reboot program.

            <h1>Overview</h1>

            <p>I am asking for your help. Seven years ago, I was laid off two weeks after having major surgery. While I have recovered, I still have some physical limitations that prevent me from getting the most common types of subsistence employment.  Last year, my wife had several unexpected medical issues and may never be able to work again. We are teetering on the edge of homelessness. I need a hand up to get back on my feet. Please consider whether your company can afford to be part of this process.
            </p>

            <p>For eight years, I worked for Seagate Technology, finishing as a Systems Senior Engineer in their Global Client Server Engineering team. By 2008, a military service connected injury was limiting me to a 20-hour work week. On December 31, 2008, I had surgery to correct this injury. Two weeks later, Seagate had the first of several large layoffs. Even though I had been awarded a 10% Key Performer bonus for 2009 in addition to my $82K salary, I was part of the first RIF.
            </p>

            <p>While recovering from surgery, I volunteered for the American
                   Legion at the local and state level. I also went to school and obtained a Web Development and Design AAS from PCC. In my second year at PCC, my family had a series of personal tragedies, resulting in my wife’s inability to work. This put a significant amount of pressure on me to quickly develop an income. With a seven-year work gap, and even though I attended PCC to pivot into web technology, after seven months I am finding it impossible to obtain employment. Now, we have exhausted all of our resources.

            <h2>Numbers to Know Redux</h2>

            <ul>

                <li><strong><span id="maxWOTCCredit"></span></strong> - the maximum WOTC credit available for me
                </li>

                <li><strong><span id="wotcWagePct"></span></strong> - the percentage of wages used to fund WOTC credits
                </li>

                <li><strong><span id="minWagePaid"></span></strong> - the total amount of wages paid required to generate the maximum credit
                </li>

                <li><strong><span id="minWOTCWeeks"></span> forty-hour equivalent weeks</strong> - the minimum time frame required by law
                </li>

                <li><strong><span id="maxWOTCWeeks"></span> forty-hour equivalent weeks</strong> (or <span id="maxWOTCYears"></span> years) - the maximum time frame, limited by the current minimum wage of <strong>$<span id="orMinWage"></span></strong>

            </ul>

            <p>In this proposal, you may find that the effective hourly wage is too high for the proposed position, or that the assumed hours worked while training value is not to your liking. The following section shows the effect of various changes.</p>

            <h2>Effective Hourly Wage Adjustments</h2>

            <p>Wages during training are essential. Working full time during training is unrealistic. The minimum hours worked while training is suggested to be 10 hours per week. You may feel that the effective wage shown is too high (or too low). If you feel that either of the default values is unacceptable, changing them will change the effective wage.
