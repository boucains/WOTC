        <p>Dear (Person),</p>

        The <a href="https://www.doleta.gov/business/incentives/opptax/" target="_blank">Work Opportunity Tax Credit</a> (WOTC) is a federal program designed to make it more cost-effective to hire <a href="https://www.doleta.gov/business/incentives/opptax/eligible.cfm" target="_blank">people in various categories</a> who have faced significant barriers to employment. A tax credit is generated, up to a maximum amount, from a percent of wages paid to the eligible employee. The credit can be as high as $9,600. Currently, this program is <a href="https://www.doleta.gov/business/incentives/opptax/pdf/PATH_Act_2015-WOTC_Interim_Instructions.pdf" target="_blank">authorized through December 31, 2019</a>.
        </p>

        <p>The Department of Labor's <a href="https://www.doleta.gov/business/incentives/opptax/PDF/WOTC_Employer_Guide.pdf" target="_blank">eligibility guidelines</a> define the qualifications of each target group.
        </p>

        <p>
        </p>

        <p>Sincerely,</p>

        <h1>Executive Summary</h1>

        <p>I am a disabled veteran who is requesting a hand up, not a hand out. After an injury and layoff in 2009, I am out of personal resources and options. This proposal allows me to attend Epicodus while providing a clear financial mechanism for you to recoup those costs and more.
        </p>

        <p>This proposal has many inherently flexible parameters. In the most likely scenario, I would begin by performing an approximately four-week internship at no cost to you, sponsored by the <a href="http://www.rebootnw.org/" target="_blank">Federal “Reboot” program</a>. Upon successful completion, I would become an employee of Epicodus for between 52 and 65 weeks in order for you to receive a <a href="https://www.doleta.gov/business/incentives/opptax/" target="_blank">Work Opportunity Tax Credit</a> (WOTC). My hourly rate would be between $9.25 and $11.54 per hour, but the effective rate would be somewhat higher as explained below. At some point during this time I would attend a full course of Epicodus training. No health insurance, vacation, or other benefits are expected. Nothing in this proposal is meant to limit the end date of my employment, but simply tracks the period required to get the maximum WOTC.
        </p>

        <p>I have a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnpatrickcain" target="_blank">wide range of technical and administrative skills</a> that are of use supporting your busy staff, as well as a lifelong drive to help others.

            <p>Wages during training are essential. Working full time during training is unrealistic. The minimum hours worked while training is suggested to be 10 hours per week.

                <h1>Proposal</h1>

                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p><strong>I am asking for your help.</strong> Seven years ago, I was laid off two weeks after having major surgery. While I have recovered, I still have some physical limitations. Even though I obtained a Web Development & Design AAS from PCC, I have been unable to obtain a job since graduation. My family is teetering on the edge of homelessness. I need a hand up to get back on my feet. Please consider whether your company can afford to be part of this process.
                </p>

                <p>In return for a full course of training while an employee, Epicodus would receive a no-cost four-week internship, my service near minimum wage for 1 - 1.25 years, and a $9,600 Work Opportunity Tax Credit. I would also pay for my tuition out of my wages, effectively increasing the value proposition further. </p>

                <h2>What I Can Bring to the Table</h2>

                <h3>Interpersonal Approach</h3>

                <p>I am adaptable, and I know how to follow. My most useful characteristic is my curiosity. I like to analyze complex problems and find innovative solutions. I accept people for who they are, and feel that respecting each other as human beings is the basis for a sound work and civic environment. I am comfortable speaking in any environment to anyone, and helping others is a life-long pattern for me. My broad curiosity and detailed approach mean that I tend to provide more information than most people need. I struggle when dealing with people who deliberately take advantage of others, especially those who cannot fight back.</p>

                <h3>Work History</h3>

                <p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnpatrickcain" target="_blank">My work history is quite diverse.</a> I’ve done production scheduling for factories, programmed 3-axis CNC manufacturing equipment, and made the cover of Popular Science as part of a product design team. Switching focus, I then provided PC and Mac desktop support, sales and service, ran a small help desk at IBM, designed and built global computer infrastructure and negotiated first of its kind software licensing features. Far from being a poly-proficient rock star, my opportunities have arisen from my curiosity and willingness to learn from others. I’ve been lucky to have opportunities and challenges to motivate me to continuously learn and explore.</p>

                <p>My last position was at Seagate Technology, where I worked for eight years, finishing as a Systems Senior Engineer in their Global Client Server Engineering team. By 2008, a military service-connected injury limited me to a 20-hour work week. On December 31, 2008, I had surgery to correct this injury. Two weeks later, Seagate had the first of several large layoffs. Even though I had been awarded a 10% Key Performer bonus for 2009 in addition to my $82K salary, I was part of the first RIF. While at PCC I realized that I am better suited for web development than design. The development aspect of my training was not sufficient to prepare me for work in the field.

            <h2>Effective Payroll</h2>

            <p>It takes $24,000 in wages to generate the maximum WOTC. That total does not change, only the amount of time involved. This means that the wage on paper can vary from about $11.54/hr for a years’ time to the minimum wage of $9.25/hr for 1.25 years’ time. The employer’s share of taxes adds another $2,856 to the cost of payroll, for a total of $26, 856.
            </p>

            <p>Next, that cost is increased by the loss of external tuition revenue and the cost of my tuition. The new total of $36,856 is then reduced by the tuition paid back through my wages (-$5,000) and the WOTC (-$9,600). That brings the effective payroll outlay down $4,600 to $22,256.
            </p>

            <p class="navPaddingBottom">Finally, there is a four-week internship involved at no cost to you. For a pay rate of $9.25, this reduces the effective payroll $1,480 to $20,778. For a pay rate of $11.54, the effective payroll is reduced by $1,846 to $20,409.

            <h1>Hourly Wage Discussion</h1>

            <h2>Overview</h2>

            <p>This proposal is predicated on my employment during training. Up front this may sound unreasonable, but the amount of the WOTC and the free four-week internship make the value proposition work. My wages are required to pay for the training as well as keep my family housed and fed. The numbers to know section has sample effective hourly rates listed as well as an effective wage calculator.
            </p>

            <h2>Actual Hours Worked</h2>

            <p>Attempting to work full time while attending your classes is unrealistic. I estimate that while in class I could work an additional 10 hours per week. A 40-hour workweek while not in training would be normal.

            <h2>Effective Hourly Wage (including Employer Tax Portions)</h2>

            <p>The effective pay rate is dependent on the number of hours worked over a given period of time. For the samples, I used 52-week and 65-week time periods. It’s important to note that the total amount paid does not change, just the period of time. Also, the pay rate listed is not what I would earn, but what you would pay including the employer portion of payroll taxes.
            </p>

            <p>The effective total payroll is obtained by the following:</p>

            <p>(yearly net wages including employer share of payroll tax) / ((total weeks * 40hrs) - ((40hrs paid - 10hrs worked) * 27 wks class) + 160hrs internship) = effective pay rate
            </p>

            <h2>Effective Hourly Wage (not including Employer Tax Portion)</h2>

            <p>For normal comparisons, hourly rates are based on the employee’s portion, which is not the full amount paid by the employer, but is used for reference. For the purpose of roughing out the job responsibilities, the effective hourly wage excluding the employer share is $13.57 for 52 weeks and $9.95 for 65 weeks.

            <h2>Teamwork Section</h2>

            <h3>Describe a Specific Time You Worked on a Close-Kint Team</h3>

            <h4>How did you contribute to the success or failure of the project?</h4>

            <p>I took a contract to program CNC equipment for a very small startup. The work began with a courier coming to my home almost every morning with a handmade model of the product under development. My job was to measure it within .001”, turn it into a 3D model, then produce a program that would be sent to a machinist to cut them.
            </p>

            <p>Immediately I had trouble reproducing the models, and had several calls with the model maker. I tried to get him to understand that I couldn’t built his prototypes, but to no avail. I just couldn’t understand his unwillingness to fix the problems, as they were clear and easy to understand. For example, ever try to cut a square inside corner with a round tool? Ain’t gonna happen! Finally, he angrily said, “You use a computer; you’re supposed to be able to do things better than what I can do!”, and I began to realize that the conflict was based in fear. This professional manual model maker was not going to be replaced by a stupid computer!
            </p>

            <p>I arranged to go over to his house one afternoon to discuss how to move forward. As he gave me a tour, I realized that he was truly an artist, with examples of beautiful consumer product development he had done. Much of it was on products that most people would have used or at least seen. He took the position, correctly, that product development is more art than science, and that computers were not art.
            </p>

            <p>Just as his world was initially a mystery to me, mine was to him as well. So, I packed up my hundred pounds of computer hardware and took it to his house. I walked through the process, and let him see what was required. It was certainly more complex than he assumed, and he began to see why I was saying there were problems. Soon, we began including the machinist as well, who was able to give me feedback on the speed of my programs and tips on how to approach holding the product during machining.
            </p>

            <p>I made sure to praise their work, and told them often that I couldn’t do their job. I created on-screen representations of actual tools so they could see in advance how they would interact with the design. Very quickly, we began to meet at each other’s homes, or at the company’s office, and design as a team. With my computer modeling skills, the model maker’s design experience and the machinist’s real-world feedback, we were able to keep pace with a very demanding schedule for a first-of-its-kind product.
            </p>

            <h4>How did you contribute to the success or failure of the project?</h4>

            <p><strong>My contributions to the success of the product were</strong></p>

            <ul>

                <li>my willingness to respect the skill sets of others</li>

                <li>praising the work of others to give them confidence about their work</li>

                <li>teaching others about my work process so we could interface more effectively</li>

                <li>diligently seeking to modify my processes so others could be more efficient</li>

            </ul>

            <h4>How did other people on the team contribute to the success or failure?</h4>

            <p><strong>The model maker’s contributions were</strong></p>

            <ul>

                <li>a willingness to learn about what was to him a very threatening technology</li>

                <li>a willingness to pass on years of product design wisdom to make my work easier</li>

                <li>flexibility in work location and timing</li>

            </ul>

            <p><strong>The machinist’s contributions were</strong></p>

            <ul>

                <li>to provide feedback on manufacturing processes</li>

                <li>education on rapid prototyping tools to speed production</li>

            </ul>

            <h4>What were your strengths as a group member?</h4>

            <p>My strengths were mostly technical at the time, but one of the biggest soft strengths was the desire to work together with other experts rather than toss my work over the wall to the next person. Next, I had a strong desire to create the supporting graphics, like exact measurements of tools, to help us find design defects before manufacturing. Finally, I built the project files as a set rather than a series of individual projects. This allowed me to place each layer together, which exposed clearance problems and allowed for rendering of each part, or all, of a product onscreen before manufacturing. While these things are common now, back then this type of creative work was rare. All of these things show my desire to make processes more efficient and products better than the competition.
            </p>

            <h4>What were your weaknesses?</h4>

            <ul>

                <li>a tendency to get frustrated about last minute changes to the design by outside influences (the deadlines were very tight, and we worked 6 – 7 days a week, so a seemingly minor change caused havoc on our production schedule)
                </li>

                <li>a failure to ask about the bigger picture which made me less supportive of project changes</li>

                <li>working too long, which led to times when I would miss a chance to work with others as a team because I was sleeping</li>

            </ul>

            <h4>How did you deal with other group members you didn't get along well with?</h4>

            <p>There was only one person I didn’t get along with, and the dislike was based in his unwillingness to work with the rest of us. We added a night machinist, and he would do things that would result in models being out of tolerance. He would then say it was my fault for giving him a bad program, even though the day shift machinist produced good parts with the same program. For a while, I tried to use the same techniques I used with the others to gain his trust, but he wasn’t interested in working together with anyone, thus the night shift job. Eventually, we just left him alone until he was fired for producing too many bad parts after the day machinist presented some stats on scrap to the owner.
            </p>

            <p>About this same time, I learned a great lesson from John W. Thompson when he was the VP of Consumer Products at IBM. I ran into him at an airport, and he was kind enough to give me 45 minutes of his time. We discussed my dissatisfaction with IBM’s marketing, and he explained why they were making the decisions they were making. I had an epiphany about this subject. I had assumed that they were a bunch of idiots, but I learned that they had solid reasons for making the decisions they made. The light bulb went on that very few people make truly stupid decisions. If I see someone making such a move, chances are that I don’t have the same set of information as the other person. By respecting them up front, I get the opportunity to hear why those “stupid” decisions were being made so I understand them, and gain the opportunity to have input into them if I have relevant information to add.
